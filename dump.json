Prior to the injury, Jesus had been performing well for Arsenal after joining the team from Manchester City, with 5 goals and 6 assists in his first season.<br /><br />Despite Gabriel Jesus' injury absence, Mikel Arteta's team has been making progress toward their first Premier League title in 19 years. However, the manager prefers to have a fully fit squad for the remainder of the season. This is why the striker's recent update on his fitness will likely be met with excitement from fans. <br /><br />Gabriel Jesus was present at the Emirates Stadium during Arsenal's thrilling 3-2 victory over Manchester United on Sunday evening. <br /><br />Despite Marcus Rashford's early goal for United, Arsenal's Eddie Nketiah, who was filling in for Jesus, scored the equalizer with a header from a well-placed cross by Granit Xhaka.</p>\r\n<p>The Gunners took the lead early in the second half with a goal from Bukayo Saka but were soon tied again by Lisandro Martinez's first goal in the Premier League.</p>\r\n<p>In the closing moments of the match, Arsenal pressed forward for a winning goal, which they found through Nketiah, who directed Martin Odegaard's shot past David de Gea for his second goal of the game.<br /><br />When questioned about his injury recovery, Gabriel Jesus stated that he would likely be returning in \"four or five weeks more.\"</p>\r\n<p>However, it will not be easy for him to immediately regain his spot in the starting lineup. Eddie Nketiah, who has filled in for Jesus, is now Arsenal's top scorer across all competitions, having scored his eighth and ninth goals of the season against Manchester United.</p>\r\n<p>After the match, Arteta praised Nketiah, calling him \"incredible\" and commending his ability to step into Jesus' role effectively.<br /><br />Arteta said: \"Eddie's performance is incredible. We couldn't have predicted this, but we had hope because of his mindset, qualities, and how well they fit within the team. Losing Jesus was a significant loss, but Eddie is stepping up and the team is responding exceptionally.\" <br /><br />The next game for Arsenal will be against Manchester City on Friday evening in the FA Cup, it will be an exciting match-up as the teams have not yet faced each other this season.</p>", "keywords": "Arsenal, Premier League, Gabriel Jesus, Khabib", "seo_description": "Gabriel Jesus announces return from injury, Arsenal fans eagerly await his comeback.", "views": 1, "created_at": "2023-01-24T05:30:49.075Z", "author": 1}}, {"model": "core.post", "pk": 3, "fields": {"category": "TRANSFERS", "url": "manchester-city-reportedly-willing-include-key-player-potential-swap-deal-rafael-leao", "heading": "Manchester City is reportedly willing to include a key player in a potential swap deal for Rafael Leao", "sub_heading": "Recent transfer rumors have suggested that Manchester City is considering a move for AC Milan player Rafael Leao, with the possibility of a key player being offered in exchange.", "image": "posts/resize.webp", "image_alt": "Rafael Leao, an AC Milan player, has been the subject of strong rumors linking him with a move to Manchester City (Image credit - Getty Images)", "content": "<p>According to reports, Manchester City is willing to exchange Joao Cancelo for AC Milan's Portugal forward, Rafael Leao.

Coincidentally, his final club was LAFC, which is based in the United States and plays in Major League Soccer.<br /><br />Gareth Bale, the retired five-time Champions League winner, surprised fans on Monday by announcing on Instagram that he will be participating in next month's AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tournament in California. <br /><br />The four-day event, which is held at Pebble Beach, has a massive $9 million prize. Although the prize money is significant, it seems that Bale is more interested in the opportunity to compete and showcase his golf skills.<br /><br />The AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tournament will feature 156 professional golfers competing across three courses: Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, and Monterey Peninsula Country Club.</p>\r\n<p>The event will also include notable celebrities such as actor Bill Murray and musician Macklemore.

Golf. Madrid. In that order,\" which caused a significant rift between him and Real Madrid fans. This led to him spending the following season on loan at Tottenham Hotspur, the club he left in 2013 to join Real Madrid. <br /><br />In a statement announcing his retirement, Bale stated that after careful consideration, he decided to retire from club and international football, feeling grateful for the opportunity to pursue his passion for the sport and for the memorable moments it provided him over 17 seasons.

The new owners are eager to avoid the mistakes made by the previous regime, which saw key players such as Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen leave on a free transfer.</p>\r\n<h4>Mount's Contract Talks Stall</h4>\r\n<p>Mason Mount, who was the Chelsea Player of the Year for the last two seasons, has been in contract talks for some time but is yet to agree on terms. Despite his accolades, Mount's form has dipped this season, leaving his future at the club in the balance.</p>\r\n<h4>Kovacic's Future in Doubt</h4>\r\n<p>Mateo Kovacic will enter the final year of his contract this summer, and the club has yet to open talks with him. As per the Evening Standard, Kovacic is unlikely to be offered a new deal and a sale in the summer looks imminent.</p>\r\n<h4>Mendy's Starting Spot Lost</h4>\r\n<p>Edouard Mendy has lost his starting spot to Kepa Arrizabalaga since Graham Potter took over as manager.

The Frenchman has yet to play under Potter and is expected to return to training in March.</p>\r\n<h4>Gallagher's Future Uncertain</h4>\r\n<p>Conor Gallagher was almost sold in the January transfer window when Everton tabled a &pound;40 million bid for the midfielder. However, the club chose to keep Gallagher and sold Jorginho to Arsenal instead. His future at Chelsea is uncertain, with several clubs reportedly circling to poach him.</p>\r\n<h2>Squad Trimming Needed</h2>\r\n<p>Chelsea has a large squad right now, and several players have been left out of the UEFA Champions League team, including Aubameyang, Noni Madueke, and Beno&icirc;t Badiashile. A squad trimming is needed in the summer, and those stalling contracts and those not regularly used by Graham Potter are likely to be the ones leaving.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, Chelsea FC is facing a crucial summer, with several key players' futures in the balance. The club's new owners will look to avoid the mistakes made by the previous regime and ensure a smooth transition for the team.
